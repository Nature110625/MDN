    <h1>Stocks and Shares</h1>
    <p>
        <a href="/">Stocks</a> and <a href="/">shares</a> both terms refer to ownership in a company. Stocks are a type
        of security that gives stockholders a share of ownership in a company. Shares are units of 
        ownership in a specific company. For example, you could own stock in Amazon 
        and Microsoft, or you could own ten Amazon shares.
    </p>

        Stocks are also known as <strong>equity</strong>. Stocks are bought and sold on stock exchanges and are the foundation of
        many individual investors' portfolios. Companies typically sell shares to gain additional money to grow the 
        company, which is called the Initial Public Offering (IPO). After the IPO, stockholders can resell shares on the
        stock market.

        Stocks represent the holder's part-ownership in one or several companies. Shares are the smallest
        denomination of a company's stock. Stocks have a broader scope, representing ownership in a sector or the 
        entire market. Shares may be partially or fully paid, while stocks are typically fully paid up.
    </p>

        The owner of a stock is entitled to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much
        stock they own. For example, if a company had 10,000 shares, and yor owned 1000 of them, you could say
        that you held a 10% equity stake in that company.
